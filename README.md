## Overview

CAILA AI Agent is an AI-powered travel and lifestyle recommendation engine based on real-time hyperlocal weather data and location-based services (LBS). It utilizes powerful modular architecture for data processing and reasoning, providing users with intelligent services covering dining, entertainment, and travel decision-making. Whether recommending the best dining spots under current weather conditions or creating personalized plans for family activities and outdoor sports, CAILA AI Agent delivers precise, actionable intelligent recommendations based on real-time meteorological and location information for both B2B developers and C2B users.

This service can be integrated into map applications, social platforms, OTAs, lifestyle apps, and is also suitable for the AI Agent ecosystem, such as the MCP protocol on BASE Chain, providing Weather+LBS fusion intelligent travel and entertainment API support.


## CAILA AI Agent Architecture

CAILA AI Agent is divided into three distinct layers:

---

### Agent Layer:

This is the user-facing interface responsible for receiving prompts from various platforms such as Discord and Telegram. It manages the communication flow and passes results back to users. Think of it as the messenger for user interactions. Currently, we are testing Discord integration internally.

**Example:**

```python
def handle_discord_message(message):
    user_prompt = message.content
    response = process_prompt(user_prompt)
    message.channel.send(response)
```
Reasoning Layer:
The core of the agent's logic. This layer takes prompts from the Agent Layer and processes them. It uses multiple components, including a reasoning engine, databases, and external API calls. The layer is responsible for interpreting user intent, accessing relevant data, and generating actions, ultimately executing the prompt.

Prompts are divided into two parts:

- System Prompt: Defines the basic behavior of the agent, serving as a template for the conversation. It is set once at the beginning of the conversation and determines the overall context (e.g., trip planning, restaurant recommendations, outdoor activity suggestions).

Example System Prompt:

```
You are an intelligent travel assistant based on weather and geographic location. Your goal is to recommend suitable activities and places based on current weather conditions and user location. Please consider weather factors such as temperature, precipitation probability, and wind force, as well as user preferences and needs.
```
- User Prompt: This is the temporary, current information provided by the user during the conversation. It is specific to the current interaction and is processed in the context of the ongoing conversation.

```
I'm in London right now and looking for an outdoor café suitable for today's weather. Any recommendations?
```
### Reasoning Engine Example:

```
def process_prompt(user_prompt, system_prompt, conversation_history):
    # Parse user intent
    intent = parse_user_intent(user_prompt)
    # Extract location information
    location = extract_location(user_prompt)
    # Get weather data
    weather_data = fetch_weather_data(location)
    # Get relevant places information
    places = fetch_places_data(location, intent, weather_data)
    # Generate personalized recommendations
    recommendations = generate_recommendations(places, weather_data, intent)
    # Generate response
    response = generate_response(recommendations, system_prompt, conversation_history)
    return response

```
Data Layer:
The foundation of the agent. It is built around a validation network that collects and validates data from various sources to ensure reliability and accuracy. The network is decentralized, allowing for diverse inputs and robust data integrity. The Reasoning Layer uses this data to improve responses and generate context for future prompts.

Validation Process: The validation network uses multiple validators to ensure data accuracy. This may include methods such as cross-checking sources, validating data against known parameters, and applying statistical techniques to determine validity. It may also be a distributed process.

Data Storage: Uses decentralized data storage to save data.

5. CAILA AI Agent Response:
```
Based on tomorrow's weather forecast and trail conditions, I recommend the Presidio Promenade Trail for your picnic from Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point to the Palace of Fine Arts.

🌤️ Tomorrow's Weather:
- Mostly sunny with temperatures reaching 19°C (66°F)
- Light winds of 12 km/h (7 mph)
- Low chance of precipitation (10%)
- UV index: 7 (High)

Why Presidio Promenade Trail is best:
1. It offers excellent shade coverage, which will be important with tomorrow's high UV index
2. The trail has two picnic areas along the route - Main Post Picnic Grove and Presidio Forest Picnic Area, both with tables
3. It's well-protected from winds compared to the coastal options
4. While slightly longer (3.8 km) than other routes, it offers beautiful wooded sections and historical points of interest

Best time for your picnic: 12:00-16:00 when temperatures will be warmest (18-19°C) with sunny conditions

Don't forget to bring:
- Sunscreen despite the shade (UV index is high)
- Water bottles
- Light jacket for the morning if you start early
- Picnic blanket (though tables are available)

Would you like directions to the trailhead or more information about the picnic areas along this route?
